  lookups are added to the constructor instead of the temporary lookups)
- Internal changes to allow more efficient object destroying
  (if used with Template::Magic >= 1.1)
- Added OH_cleanup handler to allow automatic tm object destroy
  in CLEANUP phase

- Added automagic integration with CGI::Builder::Session
- Added POD Advanced features section to simplify
  the reading of the doc
- Added POD Special Integrations section

Version 1.11
- This version contains the real 1.1 files: the 1.1 distribution
  file was a wrong outdated file. Sorry for the mismatch.
  
Version 1.1

  or 404 status header when the template is not found (unless status is
  already defined)

  the output is printed while it is produced
- Some code optimization
