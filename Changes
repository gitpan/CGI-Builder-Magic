CGI-Builder-Magic Latest Versions Changes


Version 1.11
- This version contains the real 1.1 files: the 1.1 distribution
  file was a wrong outdated file. Sorry for the mismatch.
  
Version 1.1
- Advanced method 'page_content_check' overridden with automatic set of 204
  or 404 status header when the template is not found (unless status is
  already defined)
- Added a test for 204 status
- Fixed a bug that caused the output to be collected before sending: now
  the output is printed while it is produced
- Some code optimization

Version 1.0
- First public release
